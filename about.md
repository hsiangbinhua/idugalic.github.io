For some executives, it’s about technology. For others, digital is a new way of engaging with customers.

It’s tempting to look for simple definitions, but to be meaningful and sustainable, we believe that digital should be seen less as a thing and more a way of doing things. To help make this definition more concrete, we’ve broken it down into three attributes: creating value at the new frontiers of the business world, creating value in the processes that execute a vision of customer experiences, and building foundational capabilities that support the entire structure.

Strategic application architects need to establish consistent, holistic approaches that enable the flexibility, scalability and versatility that digital business requires.

My name is Ivan Dugalic, and I'm application architect.
